# Moving Average Crossover Strategy with RSI and Momentum Filters

## Strategy Overview
This trading strategy combines three technical indicators to generate trading signals:
1. Moving Average Crossovers (trend identification)
2. Relative Strength Index (RSI) for momentum
3. Price momentum for additional confirmation

## Technical Components

### Moving Averages
The strategy employs two exponential moving averages (EMAs):
- **Fast EMA (10-period)**: Captures short-term price movements
- **Slow EMA (20-period)**: Identifies the primary trend direction

Signal generation:
- Bullish signal: Fast EMA crosses above Slow EMA
- Bearish signal: Fast EMA crosses below Slow EMA

### Relative Strength Index (RSI)
The RSI is calculated over a 14-period window:
- Oversold condition: RSI < 30
- Overbought condition: RSI > 70

### Price Momentum
Calculated as the 5-period percentage change in price:
- Bullish momentum: Price increase > 2%
- Bearish momentum: Price decrease > 2%

## Signal Generation Logic

### Entry Conditions (Long Position)
A buy signal is generated when:
1. Fast EMA crosses above Slow EMA
2. AND either:
   - RSI < 30 (oversold condition)
   - OR 5-period price momentum > 2%

### Exit Conditions (Short Position)
A sell signal is generated when:
1. Fast EMA crosses below Slow EMA
2. AND either:
   - RSI > 70 (overbought condition)
   - OR 5-period price momentum < -2%

## Strategy Rationale

### Multiple Timeframe Analysis
- Moving averages provide trend direction
- RSI indicates potential reversals
- Price momentum confirms trend strength

### Risk Management
- Multiple confirmations reduce false signals
- RSI filters help avoid overbought/oversold conditions
- Momentum confirmation adds reliability to signals

## Implementation Guidelines

### Parameter Optimization
- EMA periods can be adjusted based on:
  - Market volatility
  - Trading timeframe
  - Asset characteristics
- RSI thresholds can be modified for:
  - More/less aggressive entries
  - Different market conditions

### Risk Parameters
- Position sizing: 1-2% of portfolio per trade
- Stop loss: Based on volatility (ATR)
- Take profit: Risk-reward ratio of 1:2 or higher

## Performance Considerations

### Market Conditions
- Performs best in trending markets
- May generate false signals in ranging markets
- Effectiveness varies by asset class

### Optimization Opportunities
- Adjust EMA periods for different timeframes
- Modify RSI thresholds based on market conditions
- Fine-tune momentum thresholds for specific assets

## Strategy Limitations
- Lagging nature of moving averages
- Potential for whipsaws in volatile markets
- Requires active monitoring of market conditions

## Best Practices
1. Backtest thoroughly before live implementation
2. Monitor strategy performance regularly
3. Adjust parameters based on market conditions
4. Maintain proper risk management
5. Keep detailed trade records for analysis

## Real-World Example
Let's say you're watching TSLA (Tesla):

### Buy Scenario:
```
Day 1-9: Fast EMA = $100, Slow EMA = $105
Day 10: Fast EMA = $106, Slow EMA = $105 (crossover happens)
RSI = 28 (stock is oversold)
Price went up 2.5% in last 5 days
Result: BUY signal! ðŸš€
```

### Sell Scenario:
```
Day 1-9: Fast EMA = $110, Slow EMA = $105
Day 10: Fast EMA = $104, Slow EMA = $105 (crossover happens)
RSI = 72 (stock is overbought)
Price went down 2.1% in last 5 days
Result: SELL signal! ðŸ“‰
```
